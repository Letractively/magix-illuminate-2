a web application framework for mere human beings

[download here](https://drive.google.com/file/d/0B5khiU8I2AUXV2pET2x6R2VEVnc/edit?usp=sharing). read about magix on [our blog](https://magixilluminate.wordpress.com/). magix is built around an entirely new paradigm for oop programming called active events. though active events doesn't really replace oo, it largely replaces function and method invocations, in such a way that the methods themselves becomes polymorphistic in nature. you still keep oop btw. meaning everything is 100% c# in the code, and you'll recognize everything as good old c#, with one difference being that many of the methods in magix are marked as active events, which makes them accessible through the active event system

this might be difficult for the magix noob to grasp, but the concept of active events is extremely powerful, an effectively replaces the entirety of oo with a simple and easy to grasp concept. instead of relying upon classes, interfaces and virtual methods to implement the concept of polymorphism and encapsulation, you rely upon active events, which are generic events, which all share the same signature and data passing. this makes any active event interchangeable with any other active event, in theory. in addition it also makes all methods serializable over for instance the http protocol, meaning all active events in magix are by default easily made into web services

in addition magix has tons of other features, such as the possibility to create applications through the browser, in a fully fledged ide, built around the language of hyper lisp, which is a brain-child, and natural consequence of active event

magix also features a fully fledged ajax library, built around the concept of "managed ajax", meaning it replaces the traditional web controls, in such a way that they just become ajaxified automatically. this means you can use a web control library, in traditional user controls and web pages in the asp.net life cycle, only with the difference being that everything is automatically ajaxified, in such a way that minimum amounts of bandwidth is being consumed by your application

magix also contains a complete mvc library, built around active events for communicating between controllers and views. a view in magix though is called "module" and a controller is called "active controller".

magix is also 100% literate, meaning the system is in its entirety self-documenting, and everything needed to start using magix is contained within the system itself. to start using magix, all you need is visual studio, version 11 or better, or xamarin. open up the containing solution file and start your application. this will automatically wire up everything needed to develop magix applications for you

magix also features a vanity qr code generator. see the qr code below this text for an example of what kind of qr codes you can create with magix
